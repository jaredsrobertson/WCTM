# rlrankv2 (aka Whiff City Team Manager)

This project arose out of a desire for a self-led learning experience to familiarize myself with Python. It is a Discord bot with a variety of features currently geared towards a private Discord server shared with friends. In its current state, the bot has ChatGPT and DALL-E integration (OpenAI API), can check which Steam games are owned by server members (Steam API), and can return a user's current Rocket League rank (Selenium).

This project is still a work in progress and, though fully functioning, is rough around the edges and needs more work. I intend to address error handling and logging in a future update. I also intend to implement the ability to detect a Discord users linked Steam account, as currently user Steam profile information is hardcoded. Additionally, I would like to add both music playback as well as the ability to check the price of a game via Steam.
